      <p>Frontend engineer mixed with a rock-climber’s brain - curious, tenacious, and affable. Beyond the grip strength, climbing requires critical thinking and confidence to solve and execute body movement puzzles to get from start to finish. However, the most memorable part is sharing the experience with fellow rock-climbing peers - discussing possible solutions and adapting them to our strengths.</p>

      <p>In similar ways, programming brings out this collective spirit. With a specialized skillset consisting of JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, and webpack, I look forward to sharing frontend knowledge with my team members, as well as learning from their expertise on their favored technologies.</p>

      <p>My goals while working on a project are to create a clean solution that’s simple for future engineers to build on and to deliver a user experience that sparks excitement for the customer.</p>
